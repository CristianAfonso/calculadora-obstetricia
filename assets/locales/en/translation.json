    "guide_presentation": "This guide will enable you to use the application correctly, please follow the instructions below.",
    "specific_instruction_title": "Here you will find information about ",
    "navExplanation": "In the navigator, you can find three types of date entries, these dates will be used throughout the calculator to perform different calculations and measurements:",
    "navExp1": "1. Date of last period and ultrasound: The last menstrual period date can be manually selected from a drop-down calendar, this will provide an estimated date of birth.",
    "navExp2": "2. Days and weeks, and finally: Days and weeks can be entered manually from the corresponding input fields.",
    "navExp3": "3. Crown-rump length dating: The Crown-rump length can be entered manually in the corresponding input field, this field will overwrite the last rule date as it is a biometric dating.",
    "navExp4": "Once you click on the button with the corresponding weeks and days, a navigation menu will be displayed (on Mobile version it will display a single button that shows a side menu), allowing you to advance to the desired section of the calculator.",
    "languageExp1": "At the top right of the application you will find a globe icon (shown on this section) with a drop-down menu containing the languages of the application. Selecting the desired language will switch the calculator to that language.",
    "datationExplanation": "In the Datation tab, you can find three methodologies for biometric dating by ultrasound:",
    "datationExp1": "1. Crown-rump Length (CRL): This test measures the distance between the skull and the coccyx, The CRL can be measured starting around six or seven weeks of pregnancy up until 14 weeks.",
    "datationExp2": "2. Biparietal Diameter (BPD): is computed to produce an estimate of fetal weight.  In the second trimester this may be extrapolated to an estimate of gestational age and an estimated due date (EDD).",
    "datationExp3": "3. Femur Length (FL): is computed to produce an estimate of fetal weight. In the second trimester, this may be extrapolated to an estimate of gestational age and an estimated due date (EDD).",
    "datationExp4": "In addition, we will get two dates, the previous date in use and the new date in use once the button of the desired date is clicked.",
    "datationExp5": "Once the desired date button is clicked, this will become the date in use, overwriting the current date.",
    "biometricExplanation": "In the biometric study tab, two main sections can be seen, in the upper part the biometric study and in the lower part the haemodynamic study:",
    "biometricExp1": "In the biometric study section we can observe, in turn, two sub-sections.",
    "biometricExp2": "On the left side we can find Biometric measurements, each of which provides the percentile (shown on a bar) in which they are found for the selected gestational age:",
    "biometricExp3": "Biparietal Diameter (BPD), Head circumference (HC), Abdominal circumference(AC), Femur Length (FL)",
    "biometricExp4": "On the right side (below in the mobile version), we can find different formulas with which we can find the estimated weight based on the values entered in the previous section for the gestational age entered. We can select Hadlock 2 (Uses HC, AC and FL), Hadlock 3 (Uses BPD, AC and FL) or enter the weight manually. These weights will be represented in the lower bars, showing the estimated weight for the current gestational age, the percentile in which it is located and the zscore.",
    "biometricExp5": "In the hemodynamic study section we can observe, in turn, two sub-sections.",
    "hemodynamicExp1": "Firstly, we can see three input fields where we can enter the pulsatility index (PI) of the umbilical artery (UA), the pulsatility index (PI) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), and the pulsatility index (PI) of the umbilical artery (UA).",
    "biometricExp6": "Below we can see different percentile bars comparing the results obtained in the previous section with the values of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona and the Hospital Gregorio Marañón, offering different percentile bars.",
    "hemodynamicExplanation": "In the hemodynamic study tab, two main sections can be seen, in the upper part the hemodynamic study where every data has his own percentile bar and scores and in the lower part, the haemodynamic chart:",
    "hemodynamicExp2": "In the middle section of this tab, we can observe the entry of the fields Systolic Peak (SP) and the left and right uterine arteries (UA), these values will give value to the field mean uterine arteries (UA mean).",
    "hemodynamicExp3": "The last section of this tab consists of the values of the venous ductus (VD) and aortic isthmus (AI) fields.",
    "hemodynamicExp4": "Input fields of hemodynamic Studio, all those fields uses pulsatility index (PI) as value measurement",
    "hemodynamicExp5": "Chart section: here we can observe a static chart that has the value of all the measures studied on this section for differents gestational ages",
    "bonesExplanation": "In the Long Bones tab, two main sections can be seen, we can see input fields, their respective scores and percentile bars for the arm and leg bones.:",
    "bonesExp1": "First, we visualised the input fields for the bones of the arm, the bones studied are: Humerus, Ulna and Radius.",
    "bonesExp2": "Next, we can see the bones relating to the leg. These bones are: Femur, tibia, fibula and foot.",
    "lancetExplanation": "The lancet section carries out a multi-centre study showing information on the Gregorio Marañón, Clinic, Talavera and Fuenlabrada Hospitals. This tab contains two main sections:",
    "lancetExp1": "Top section: Using the entry field for foetal weight and biological gender, we can see the differences in measurements between the hospitals studied.",
    "lancetExp2": "Lower section: In this section we can see a dynamic graph with the expected weight values for each hospital and their p10-p90 ranges, in addition, we can see a point generated with the weight of the foetus and its gestational age.",
    "unicVsMultipleExplanation": "The single vs. multiple tab makes a comparison between single foetus, two foetus and three foetus gestations. There are two distinct sections on this tab:",
    "unicVsMultipleExp1": "Top section: Using the entry field for foetal weight, biological gender and the amount of foetus selected, we can see the differences in measurements between the the number of simultaneous foetuses.",
    "unicVsMultipleExp2": "Lower section: In this section we can see a dynamic graph with the expected weight values for single and double foetus and their p10-p90 ranges, in addition, we can see a point generated with the weight of the foetus and its gestational age.",
